#to open a txt file, use
file = open("wsg.txt", "r")
#r means read, which means that we cannot edit this file from this variable

#to read a txt, use
print(file.read())
#to read the first x amount of characters (starting at 1), use
print(file.read(25))
#to read a specific line, use
print(file.readline())
#multiple readline code pieces will read the line after the last.

#To return all the lines in a file as a list with each list item being a line (idk what this means either), use
print(file.readlines())
#make sure to close the txt using
file.close()

#a means append, which means that you can add text to the end of the txt
#w means write, which means that you can delete everything and write something new
file2 = open(wsg.txt, "a")
#to append text to the end of the txt, use
file2.write("this is the stuff we are adding wowie zowie")
print(file2.read())
file2.close()


#python can work with files using the os path.
#the os path allows you to find, create, manage, delete, and maintain different folders.
#the io path allows you to read from and write to files

#a module is another name for a single .py file with Python code
#a package is a folder that can contain multiple modules

#the import keyword is used to load other python source code files into your current code page. To access other folders, we import the io path with the following code:
import os

#Let's say we wanted to use a specific function that you already coded, but it's in a different Python file. There's no need to retype all that code. You can simply import that function into your code.

#For example, let's say we wanted to use the function adventure() that lives in the path module of the os package. We would use the following code:
#os.path.adventure

#this is to check if the specified file exists or not. the function returns a boolean.
print(os.path.isfile("C:\\Users\owl.png"))

#this is to check if the directory exists or not. also a boolean.
print(os.path.isdir("C:\\Users"))

#this will remove a file from a directory.
os.path.remove("C:\\Users\owl.png")

#this is used to retun the file name.
print(os.path.basename("/squirrel/elephantgreenscreeneffect.gif"))
#will print elephantgreenscreeneffect.gif

#this gives us the directory name where the folder / file is located
print(os.path.dirname("/squirrel/elegif.gif"))
#will print squirrel

#When you start a Python file, one of the things it creates automatically is a list that contains all of directories it will use to search for modules when importing. This list is available in a variable named sys.path. Note that the empty '' entry means the current directory.
sys.path
#sys can also display error messages that would otherwise not show
